# The CMakeLists.txt included with zlib unconditionally makes all the dylibs AND also
# makes "appplication" executables.  This is not great for making a sdk for ios.
# this custom script just runs it building the static lib only:
cmake -S temp/src -B temp/build -G Xcode -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fPIC" -DSKIP_INSTALL_FILES=YES
cmake --build temp/build --target zlibstatic --config Release -j 8
