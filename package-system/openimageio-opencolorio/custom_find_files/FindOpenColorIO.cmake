# we build OpenColorIO statically.  This also means that all its dependencies
# are built statically, which means that if you want to link to OpenColorIO, you will need those
# dependencies too.   Unfortunately, OpenColorIO's install script and its own generated target
# files do not declare these dependencies.   This file "patches" that by providing both OpenColorIO
# and its dependencies.

# this is only for use during building of OpenImageIO.
# it assumes that there is an OpenColorIO 'install' folder relative to this one.

# a useful message since it MUST APPEAR if this is working
