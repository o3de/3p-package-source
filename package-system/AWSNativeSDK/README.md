# Build New AWS Service Target in AWSNativeSDK
## Overview

This package defines and builds the AWS C++ SDK libarires for O3DE. It builds all core libraries and an opinionated subset of AWS client libraries. To add a new AWS Service client (or target) please use the example and instructions below.

Find and identify the service package(s) required from the package directory at [aws/aws-sdk-cpp](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp) on GitHub. Refer to the [AWS SDK for C++ Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/welcome.html) for further help.
The package name is the suffix of the directory name for the service.

```
aws-sdk-cpp\aws-cpp-sdk-<packageName>   # Repo directory name and packageName
aws-sdk-cpp\aws-cpp-sdk-s3              # Example: Package name is s3
```

Note: If the AWS service package is not currently available in AWSNativeSDK, then please upgrade AWSNativeSDK version first.

## Example: Build ElasticSearch (ES)

### 1. Check [aws/aws-sdk-cpp](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp) for aws-cpp-sdk-es

### 2. Add ElasticSearch as part of AWSNativeSDK build target
Modify AWSNativeSDK build script by adding ElasticSearch as a build target. The example below uses the windows build script as a reference:

```
aws-cpp-sdk-es shared and static libraries will be generated after AWSNativeSDK is built.

### 3. Create a 3rdParty library target for ElasticSearch
Modify FindAWSNativeSDK.cmake file by creating a new target for ElasticSearch, The example below uses the windows cmake file as a reference:

[FindAWSNativeSDK.cmake.Windows](https://github.com/o3de/3p-package-source/blob/main/package-system/AWSNativeSDK/FindAWSNativeSDK.cmake.Windows)

It is up to the consumer to pull aws-cpp-sdk-es shared and static libraries as build and runtime dependencies by using `3rdParty::AWSNativeSDK::ElasticSearch` target.

### 4. Update AWSNativeSDK with correct version and revision
Modify build config and list file to bump AWSNativeSDK with correct version and revision value. The example below uses the windows build as a reference:

As current version is `1.9.50-rev2`, bump it to `1.9.50-rev3` for example
